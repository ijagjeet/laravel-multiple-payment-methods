 * And this time, we need to add the possibility to send any HTTP request to any service.
We need to consume the APIs from our payment platforms, PayPal, Stripe or any other that you want to add.
And for that, we can use a very important or interesting library that is called "GuzzleHTTP".
Guzzle is a PHP library, of course, that allow us to use several components and classes, to send
easily HTTP request with different methods, different URLs, different components or bodies
